# Stripe Dashboard UI Clone

I built this as a portfolio item to show off my User Interface building skills using React Js.

Live demo can be viewed [here](https://stripe-dashboard-ui-clone.netlify.app/)

## Stack:

Create React App
React Icons

## What this is:

Showcasing my ability to quickly build UI/UX experiences in the browser.

## What this isn't:

- Interactive, you can look to some of my other repositories if you would like to see how I consume API's etc.
- Mobile responsive (by design).
- Pixel perfect, but not bad for a few hours work!
